  This code is a modification of the original Eventlog to Syslog Script written by
  Curtis Smith of Purdue University. The original copyright notice can be found below.
  
  The original program was modified by Sherwin Faria for Rochester Institute of Technology
  in July 2009 to provide bug fixes and add several new features. Additions include
  the ability to ignore specific events, add the event timestamp to outgoing messages,
  a service status file, and compatibility with the new Vista/2k8 Windows Events service.
